# Steamworks.gml
A native extension for GameMaker: Studio that implements various Steam API features not covered by the built-in functions - most importantly, P2P networking, lobbies, and matchmaking.

## Usage

1. Set up GameMaker: Studio for Steamworks SDK development ([see doc](http://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/216754138-Using-The-Steamworks-SDK-With-GameMaker-Studio)).
2. Enable Steamworks support for desired platform(s) in Global Game Settings, "Steam" tab. Don't forget to set the game ID.
3. Import the "Steamworks.gml" extension (from ./Steamworks.gmx/extensions) to your desired project.
4. Have the game call steam_net_update once per step (required for steam events to dispatch).

If all is well, upon running the game you'll see `Steamworks.gml initialized successfully.` in the CompileForm.

`Steamworks.gml failed to link with Steam API.` means that either the Steam client is not running, or you have specified an incorrect App ID.

`Steamworks.gml binary is not loaded.` means that the DLL/DyLib/SO could not be loaded, usually due to the native extension file missing or being otherwise inaccessible.

## Building

Download or clone the repository.

Create a "Steamworks" directory and place [Steamworks SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/) there.  
You must pick a Steamworks version that matches the recommended version for your version of GameMaker (e.g. 1.42 for GMS2.3 - see [helpdesk](https://help.yoyogames.com/hc/en-us/articles/227860547-GMS2-Required-SDKs)).  
Steamworks' `Readme.txt` should be located at `Steamworks/Readme.txt` as result.

**Windows:** Open the included Visual Studio solution and order it to make a x86 build.

**Linux:** Run build_linux_gms#.sh. You'll need cpp:i386, gcc:i386, and g++:i386 installed.
```bash
make release_linux32 STEAMWORKS_SDK=../../Steamworks
```

**Mac OSX:** Run build_osx_gms#.sh. You'll need XCode command line tools installed.

The extension is automatically updated to reflect the functions/macros from the source code as a post-build step in the Visual Studio project (via [gmxgen](https://bitbucket.org/yal_cc/gmxgen)).
Copy `GmxGen.exe` (build it yourself or get one from Downloads) into `Steamworks.gml` directory or add it to your PATH.
